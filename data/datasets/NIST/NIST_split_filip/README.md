## This dataset is created by the following steps:
1. Create msp splits using FILIP JOZEFOV's notebook data/nist_cleaning_splitting.ipynb
   - it dorps ~60k spectra that don't have some form of proper identifier (smiles, inchikey)
   - split 0.8:0.1:0.1
2. Create jsonl files by the function msp_file_to_jsonl from spectra_process_utils.py (for 'train' and then 'test' and 'valid'):

```python
from spectra_process_utils import msp_file_to_jsonl
from pathlib import Path

dataset_path = Path("data/datasets/NIST/NIST_split_filip")
dataset_type = "train"
source_token = "<nist>"
msp_file_to_jsonl(dataset_path / f"{dataset_type}.msp",
                tokenizer_path,
                source_token,
                path_jsonl=dataset_path / f"{dataset_type}.jsonl",
                keep_spectra=True
                )
```
