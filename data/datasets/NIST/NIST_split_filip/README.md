# NIST dataset
This dataset made of NIST20 is destereochemicalized, canonicalized, and split into train, test, and validation sets (with no overlaps). For more info refer to the scripts. 
It only contains jsonl files with `mz`, `intensity`, and `smiles` fields. The filtering and preprocessing is meant to be done on-the-fly (for more freedom in testing preprocessing methods).

## This dataset is created by the following steps:
1. Create msp splits using my updated version of FILIP JOZEFOV's notebook data/nist_cleaning_splitting.ipynb
   - it dorps ~60k spectra that don't have some form of proper identifier (smiles, inchikey)
   - split 0.8:0.1:0.1
2. Create jsonl files by the function msp_file_to_jsonl from spectra_process_utils.py (for 'train' and then 'test' and 'valid'):

```python
import sys
sys.path.append("..")
from spectra_process_utils import msp_file_to_jsonl
from pathlib import Path

tokenizer = None
for dataset_type in ["train", "valid", "test"]:
    dataset_path = Path("../data/datasets/NIST/NIST_split_filip")
    msp_file_to_jsonl(path_msp=dataset_path / f"{dataset_type}.msp",
                      tokenizer = tokenizer,
                      path_jsonl=dataset_path / f"{dataset_type}.jsonl",
                      keep_spectra=True,
                      do_preprocess=False
                      )
```
