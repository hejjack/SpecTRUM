This dataset was created by filtering 30M ZINC slice dataset. The filtering process 
suits the RASSP model trained by Ales Krenek (following the official RASSP model repo)

There is 4.8M SMILES in the dataset. The preprocessing further cut the number of molecules,
finally the lengths of splits are:
    - train 4322581
    - valid 240143
    - test 240144
