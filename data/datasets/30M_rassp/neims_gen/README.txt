This dataset was created by filtering 30M ZINC slice dataset. The filtering process 
suits the RASSP model trained by Ales Krenek (following the official RASSP model repo)

There is 4.8M SMILES in the dataset. The preprocessing further cut the number of molecules,
finally the lengths of splits are:
    - train 4283848
    - valid 237990
    - test  237990
